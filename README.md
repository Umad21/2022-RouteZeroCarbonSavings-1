## Overview
\
_RouteZero's route planning, carbon analytics, and social media tools help your company cut business travel time & cost, while reaching your Net-Zero goals._ - [RouteZero](https://enterprise.routezero.world/)
-------

Businesses lack access to a tool that can empirically guide them towards net-zero with respect to their biggest source of emission: travel. Up until now this is a process guided at least in part and sometimes solely by intuition. This is an inefficient process in terms of time and cost, and our tool will provide a better alternative. \
The Enterprise Carbon Savings Prediction web application aims to provide accurate predictions of how a company's carbon footprint will reduce as their employees switch to low-carbon travel. \
This will have two main components:
- Front-end created in React
- A backend API in SpringBoot to interface with RouteZero's API

## User Journeys
**Small climate-conscious business**, visits website looking for a cost-effective way to make as large an impact on their emissions as possible. They land on the [main page](https://enterprise.routezero.world/) and discover that travel contributes largly to corporate emissions.\
They will be able to access the landing page of our app where they will be able to upload their travel data as a ``csv`` file. This travel data will ideally look like journeys of their employees over a representative period of time.\
They get back a panel containing two graphs on the right, and a selection of policies to enforce low-carbon travel. By selecting these policies the company is able to manage effect against budget. This is a small company that may not have the incentive or capital to go all in, and our app will allow them to start small.

**Large incentivized business**, the journey will look similar. They may have a lot more data, which will possibly afford them more policy options that display on their left.
